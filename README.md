This is an adaption of luke's Flora bot from Thingiverse
( https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3419428 ), redesigned to use
the more common MG90S servos, rather than the ones originally selected for it.
It's also gradually being reverse engineered into SCAD files as I replace
components with more modern ones.

for instance, the battery compartment (fitted for NiMH cells) I've redesigned
to take dual 18650's. I've also simplified the hip/knuckle design so that it
can be printed on an FDM printer, and take not be disadvantaged by the inherrant
anisotropy of the resultant shape (i.e. torsion in the X/Z and Y/Z planes is 
much weaker than the X/Y plane).
